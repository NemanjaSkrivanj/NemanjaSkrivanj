- 👋 Hi, I’m Nemanja Skrivanj.
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack web development. My passions lie in both front-end and back-end. For back-end development, I usually use Node.js with Express and MySQL/NoSQL.
- 🌱 I graduated with an 8.55 GPA. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all types of projects, ranging from Website designs, to applications or full e-commerce shops.
- 📫 You can reach me through my GitHub profile, and take a look into the side projects I've developed during my time at university.
